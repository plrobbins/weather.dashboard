# Weather Dashboard
This weather dashboard will use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities.

# What The Dashboard Will Do
* When I search for a city, the city will populate the current and future conditions for that city. It will also be added to the search history.
* The current weather conditions for that city will display the city name, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed and the UV index.
* The weather conditions for a city will also display the 5-day forecast.
* When I close the website and open it again, I am presented with the last searched city forecast. 

# The Finished Product
Below is an image of the completed Weather Dashboard.
